## Simple example

This RMarkdown document shows how to simply use the `knitrdrawio` library.
Given an existing *draw.io* diagram (here, `workflow.drawio`), create a code
chunk similar to the following:

```{drawio workflow, src="workflow.drawio", fig.cap="An example workflow."}
```

In the result document, the image exported by *draw.io* from the diagram will
be shown in place of the code chunk.

Note that the **engine** (i.e., the first word after the `{`) must be `drawio` ;
the **label** (i.e., the second word) should be meaningful.
The `src` option is mandatory and must point to the desired diagram.

You can add other options, as demonstrated here with the `fig.cap` options.
