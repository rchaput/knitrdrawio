# Motivations

It feels natural and intuitive to use **knitrdrawio** as part of a Continuous
Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow, for example to
automatically your document or book, each time you push a commit.

However, CI/CD typically runs in a *headless* environment, a server without
a graphical display, and/or in Docker containers.

**knitrdrawio** requires additional dependencies to work in such environments,
because of known limitations of the draw.io executable.
Being an Electron-based application, draw.io expects and requires a graphical
display, and needs to be tricked into thinking there is one available.

*Note*: if your system is mis-configured, **knitrdrawio** might believe to
be in a *headless* environment, and complain!
In this case, you must make sure that your `$DISPLAY` environment variable
is correctly set, so that **knitrdrawio** (and, more importantly, drawio itself)
may find your display.
In particular, if the `$DISPLAY` variable is empty, there certainly is a problem.

# How to

Two methods are available:

* the first one simply requires additional system dependencies but no setup
  (**knitrdrawio** will handle it internally) ;
* the second one requires the same dependencies but an additional setup.

Both methods require you to install on the system the following dependencies:

* [xvfb]: a virtual display server that behaves as if a "true" graphical
  display was connected. Read more on the [man page][xvfb-man].
* [libgbm1] and [libasound2]: libraries that drawio does not include but requires.

These system dependencies can be simply installed through your distribution's
package manager, e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu and Debian-derivatives systems.
Please check with your package manager for the appropriate packages, the
name might differ.

Also, it is **strongly** recommended to use [drawio v16.0.0][drawio16],
when using **knitrdrawio** in a CI/CD or headless environment.

Later versions of drawio (from the 16.0.2) ship with Electron 16.x.x,
which seems to have a problem with D-Bus.

## Simple method

Step 1. Simply install the required dependencies `xvfb`, `libgbm1`, and
`libasound2`.

Step 2. Profit. **knitrdrawio** will automatically detect you are in a
headless environment, and invoke drawio with the correct arguments to
use `xvfb`.

## "Performance"-focused method

The previous method has the advantage of being simple and not requiring
additional setup, except for the dependencies.
However, there might be an overhead due to **knitrdrawio** internally
invoking `xvfb-run` each time a diagram must be rendered.
As the number of your diagrams grows, the overhead might become
noticeable.

To avoid this, this method creates a virtual server before **knitrdrawio** is
launched, and makes the same virtual server be used for all diagrams.
Thus, the overhead of starting a virtual server is paid only once.

Step 1. Install the required dependencies.

Step 2. *Before* rendering your document through knitr or rmarkdown, choose
a display number, which must be unique on the machine (usually `99` should
work).
  Set the `$DISPLAY` environment variable to `:<your number>`, e.g.,
  `export DISPLAY=:99` (do not forget the `:` part).
  Start the virtual server with `Xvfb &`.

Step 3. You can now render your document. The virtual server as a background
process will make drawio believe there is a graphical display available.

The complete workflow should look like this, assuming an Ubuntu distribution:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xvfb libgbm1 libasound2
export DISPLAY=:99
Xvfb &
R -e 'rmarkdown::render("my_document.Rmd")'
```

# Bypassing the headless-detection

By default, **knitrdrawio** tries to detect whether the current system is
headless, by relying on the `xrandr` tool, or, if it is not available, the
`$DISPLAY` environment variable.

If, for some reason, this detection does not work, or you want to increase
performance by avoiding this check every time a chunk is rendered, the
detection can be bypassed by setting a global option:

    ```r
    options("knitrdrawio.headless" = FALSE)
    ```

This option is applied to all subsequent calls to the **knitrdrawio** engine,
and should thus be placed as early as possible.
A common place for global options is the `.Renv` file, which is loaded by R
at the beginning of a session.
Using a `.Renv` file makes it easy to have different configurations for a local
development system versus a CI/CD headless workflow.

The following values are recognized:

- `NULL` (default): perform the headless-detection each time.
- `FALSE`: assume the system is *not* headless, do not perform the detection.
- `TRUE`: assume the system *is* headless, do not perform the detection, and
  always apply the "headless workaround" through `xvfb`.

*Warning*: *drawio* will fail if the system is headless but no workaround, such
as `xvfb`, is set up. You may also use the `FALSE` value to disable
**knitrdrawio**'s built-in workaround, if you prefer to manually set up another
one.
